  sentences:
  - Grandpa! What Happened? Where did the music go!
  - This CD is old, and it doesn't work anymore. We need to find new ones to play
    more music.
  - How do we find new CDs?
  - "The CDs have been locked away in special paintings. To get through the paintings
    and get CDs, you will have to learn various elements of music theory. I've given
    you a magical journal to aid you \nthrough each painting. You can \naccess it
    by pressing F."
  - ALRIGHT, LET'S GO GRANDPA!
  - "Oh ho ho, you seem to have fallen in love with music, haven't you? Why don\u2019t
    you follow me?"
