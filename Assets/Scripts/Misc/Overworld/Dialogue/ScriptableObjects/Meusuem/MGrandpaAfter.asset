  sentences:
  - Tremendous work, sonny!
  - "\u2026"
  - "Seems like it\u2019s come time for you to know the truth."
  - When I was a little boy, just like you, me and my friend, Mortaldi, were the
    best composing duo in all the world.
  - You know what a composer is right? They write music. You were named after a composer,
    Mendelsonny.
  - But there came a dark time when Mortaldi had lost his ways.
  - I had decided to settle down and become a family man, while Mortaldi went down
    a dark path.
  - "He believed that only the people who have spent their lives studying it should
    be able to listen and appreciate it\r. He decided to take all music from the
    world, locking it away in those paintings so only those with musical expertise
    could access it."
